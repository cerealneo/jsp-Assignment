Unplugged Boy - TWS(투어스)

I know it’s complicated
I wanna go on up, let’s elevate it
So many times that I’ve been down, yeh
Let’s forget and hit the town, yeh

I wanna share what’s on my mind
All of the time
I finally dare show every side
Coming alive

Cuz with you I feel united, yeh nited
Now I know I’m not the only

I’ll be there in no time
Yeh I used to play unplugged,
let’s amplify the music
Woo
Turn up the volume, up to the sky

Let’s play it loud tonight, yeh
I’m with you, when I’m not
We face it all together

No matter what you got, yeh
I hype you up, let’s do it
We face it all together

I’ll be there in no time
I’ll be there in a minute, yeh eh
Without saying a word,
I’ll be right by your side

Go louder ‘til the sunrise
Sounds better when unplugged
Keep up the music music

Locker number 42, there’s a sign
I see in writing 1 for all and all for 6
We’re shouting woo
I’m feeling brand new
Woo yeh
Forever always, everyday yeh, oh

I’ll be there in no time
Yeh I used to play unplugged,
let’s amplify the music
Woo
Turn up the volume, up to the sky

Let’s play it loud tonight, yeh
I’m with you, when I’m not
We face it all together

No matter what you got, yeh
I hype you up, let’s do it
We face it all together

I’ll be there in no time
I’ll be there in a minute, yeh eh
Without saying a word,
I’ll be right by your side

Go louder ‘til the sunrise
Sounds better when unplugged
Keep up the music music

A click, a turn, a twist
Unlock it just like this
Forever in this place
Cause we are united, oh

So take a chance
No matter where we go
You know we’ll be there
I’m counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
The memories that we share

Let’s play it louder now
This is what life’s about
We raise the roof turn it up to the sky

Let’s play it loud tonight, yeh
I’m with you, when I’m not
We face it all together face it all together

No matter what you got, yeh
I hype you up, let’s do it wo uh uh
We face it all together

I’ll be there in no time
I’ll be there in a minute, yeh eh
Without saying a word,
I’ll be right by your side right by side

Go louder ‘til the sunrise yeh eh
Sounds better when unplugged
Keep up the music music
